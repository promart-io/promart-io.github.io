The Seller Dashboard is the main tool provided by ProMART platform for the Sales Representatives. It is a micro-CRM application helping in managing contacts and opportunities related to direct sales. It is built by the means of the platform itself and can evolve with it based on the feedback from the users.

The Dashboard itself is personalized and secured, hence only the Sales Representative itself can decide on sharing information with the Vendor(s) he/she has an offer to.
