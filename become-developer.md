By becoming a ProMART Developer you will get the following permissions and capabilities on the platform:

* Access to the high-productivity development environment. You can build your modules by using a set of rapid application development techniques (RAD) such as Entity Data Modeling with highly customizable Templates, low-code REST frameworks or just to add your custom modules;
* Integrate your components with the Extensibility framework, which will make them ready for composing into solutions afterwards;
* Be allowed to register your modules to the Component Registry;
* Receive a fair share from the EcoTax;
* Have access to all the collaboration tools;

To build a sustainable developers network where all the participants have an incentive to contribute and ability to support the available modules we decided to set-up the following rules:

* Everything built via the development environment supported by ProMART will be an open source software under EPL v2. This also includes the development environment itself;
* There will not be a single person or company holding the ownership over the code base he/she/they have contributed; Forks are not forbidden, but forks made by unethical reasons will be investigated;
* All the participants have rating as stars, which will make the evaluation of their modules easier for the Vendors; Vendors have similar rating as well;
