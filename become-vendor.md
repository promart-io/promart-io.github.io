Being a ProMART Vendor, you are part of a partner network producing the highly valuable, industry specific and instantly accessible software.

* You will be given an access to the Solution Composer, where you can select from the large number of high quality modules to compose an application you believe will be attractive for the end-customers.
* Based on the number of the modules or the support level or any other categorization you might have, you can register one or more products into the Marketplace. The recommended sales model is based on the flat monthly fees per instance. You can set the prize tag in the way to include also the flat EcoTax fee, which will be distributed equally to all the modules you selected to be included to the given application.
* You are allowed to compose solutions only from your own software components (registered by the Developer role), but it is highly recommended and will be valued the inclusion of modules written by others.
* You can register and configure your infrastructure landscape(s), where the end-user application instances will be running. The operational cost of the infrastructure itself as well as the monitoring and support are part of the Vendor's obligations, hence has to be accumulated as well in the final price of the application.

In case a Sales Representative make a deal of your product as direct selling, you have to negotiate the exact fee or percentage you give to that person or legal entity.
