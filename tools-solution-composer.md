The Solution Composer is the major Vendor's tool provided by the ProMART platform. This is the place where the Vendors can select a set of software components available in the Component Registry to include them in a Solution bundle. It can be afterwards published as a Product with different Plans to the Marketplace.

By including a given Component to a Solution, the Vendor agrees that to this component will be distributed an equal share from the EcoTax as all the others included.

The EcoTax is formed as a percentage of the purchase order amount of a Product based on a Solution. The EcoTax is the way ProMART tries to attract developers of the software components to join and contribute to ProMART business network. They will receive shares to their e-wallets as micro-payments each time a solution containing their component get sold.
