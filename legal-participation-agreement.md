IMPORTANT: PLEASE NOTE, THAT TO USE THE PROMART PLATFORM OR MATERIALS, YOU MUST AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW. PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION PROVISION SET FORTH IN SECTION 24 BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT REQUIRES YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH SAP ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 24.3 , THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. BY VIRTUE OF YOUR ELECTRONIC EXECUTION OF THIS PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT, YOU WILL BE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION PROVISION) AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION.

1. THE PROMART PLATFORM.
The ProMART Platform provides a marketplace where the following constituents can connect to negotiate and complete transactions: third-party vendors of certain products ("Vendors"); parties willing to sell Vendor-provided products ("Closers"); potential buyers of the Vendor-provided products ("Buyers"); and parties willing to refer potential Buyers to Vendors and/or Closers ("Referrers"). You are entering into this Participation Agreement to be eligible to be a Closer and/or Referrer. The ProMART Platform is a platform. SAP is not involved in the actual transactions between Vendors, Buyers, Closers, and/or or Referrers, except, in conjunction with a third-party payment processor, to facilitate payment. SAP makes the ProMART Platform to enable potential Closers and Referrers to identify, determine the suitability of, and indicate interest in, certain Vendor-provided opportunities and to enable Vendors to identify, determine the suitability of, and indicate interest in, the services of, potential Closers and/or Referrers. SAP has no control over and does not guarantee: that any Vendor will select you as a Referrer or Closer for any product on the ProMART Platform; the existence, quality, safety or legality of products offered by Vendors; that any Vendor will pay you a Sales Fee (as defined below) as a Closer or a Referral Fee (as defined below) as a Referrer; the truth or accuracy of any Vendor’s product listings; the ability of Buyers to pay for products; your ability to perform or comply with any Vendor requirements; or that a Buyer will actually complete a transaction.

2. REGISTRATION.
2.1. ACCOUNT; PROFILE.
To access some features of the ProMART Platform, you must create an account and complete a user profile. When you create an account and user profile on the ProMART Platform, you may be required to provide SAP with some information about yourself. You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information in connection with the creation of your account and user profile. As part of the functionality of the ProMART Platform, you may be able to create or complete your account and/or user profile, or login to your account, through online accounts you may have with third parties including, without limitation, social network accounts (each such account, an "SSO Account") by either providing your SSO Account login information through the ProMART Platform or allowing SAP to access your SSO Account.

2.2. USERNAME AND PASSWORD.
When you create an account on the ProMART Platform, you will be asked to choose a username and password. You are entirely responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your ProMART Platform account and user profile. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, you must immediately change your password and notify SAP by sending an email to: report@promart.io.

2.3. PARTICIPATION LEVEL.
When you create your ProMART Platform account or user profile, you will be prompted to indicate your desired level of participation on the ProMART Platform (e.g., whether you are interested in facilitating sales of products directly to potential Buyers as a Closer and/or referring potential Buyers to Vendors or Closers as a Referrer). Your eligibility to participate in the ProMART Platform, in general, is subject to SAP’s eligibility determination pursuant to Section 2.4 of this Participation Agreement. In addition, your eligibility to be a Closer and/or Referrer for particular products on the ProMART Platform may be subject to the applicable Vendor’s approval. If you indicate an interest in being a Closer or Referrer for particular products on the ProMART Platform, the Vendor may require you to demonstrate, to the Vendor’s satisfaction, that you have fulfilled the eligibility requirements provided by the applicable Vendor.

2.4. ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION.
By entering into this Participation Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that your eligibility to use the ProMART Platform, and your participation level on the ProMART Platform, will be conditioned on your provision, and SAP’s verification, of information you provide about yourself including Your Information (as defined below). You acknowledge and agree that the information you provide about yourself (including about your identity) will be subject to verification, including, without limitation, through comparison against third-party databases and/or the verification of one or more official government or legal documents that confirm your identity. You authorize SAP to, directly or through third parties, make any inquiries or take any actions SAP considers necessary to verify your identity, determine your continued eligibility to use the ProMART Platform, and verify information that you have provided through the ProMART Platform. You acknowledge and agree that SAP reserves the right, at any time, to deactivate your ProMART Platform account or user profile, or to otherwise restrict you from accessing or using the ProMART Platform. Without limiting the foregoing, if SAP is unsuccessful in verifying your identity or determining that you are eligible to use the ProMART Platform, SAP may, at its option, terminate this Participation Agreement with immediate notice to you. By entering into this Participation Agreement, and each time you access or use the ProMART Platform or the Materials, you represent that you are not: (a) a citizen or resident of a geographic area in which access to or use of the ProMART Platform is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act; (b) a citizen or resident of, or located in, a geographic area that is subject to United States, international, or other sovereign country sanctions or embargoes; or (c) an individual, or an individual employed by or associated with an entity, identified on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the U.S. Department of State’s Debarred Parties List or otherwise ineligible to receive items subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations or other economic sanction rules of any sovereign nation.

2.5. ELECTRONIC NOTICES.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Participation Agreement to the contrary, you agree that SAP and SAP’s third-party payment processor may provide you any Communications electronically as described in the Electronic Communications Delivery Policy (the "eCOMMUNICATIONS POLICY").

By granting SAP access to any SSO Account, you understand that SAP may access, store, and make available on the ProMART Platform, any content that you have provided to, or stored in, your SSO Account including without limitation any friend, connection, mutual friend, mutual connection, contacts or following/followed lists (the "SSO Content") so that it is available on and through the ProMART Platform to SAP and/or other users of the ProMART Platform. The SSO Content constitutes part of "Your Information" for the purposes of this Participation Agreement. Depending on the privacy settings that you have set in such SSO Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your SSO Accounts may be available on and through the ProMART Platform. You acknowledge and agree to update Your Information to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness. You agree that you will not create more than one user profile or account and you agree not to ask or allow another person to create a user profile or account on your behalf, for your use, or for your benefit. You will provide content, data and information including, without limitation, Your Information through the ProMART Platform ("Your Content"), which will include your user profile, information about your use of, and participation level on, the ProMART Platform, to be shown to potential Vendors, Buyers, Referrers and Closers. You represent that Your Content will be truthful, accurate, and complete. By providing Your Content, you grant SAP a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to use, reproduce, perform, display, distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all of Your Content, and to sublicense the foregoing rights to SAP's affiliates and operators of any website or other online point of presence through which the ProMART Platform is syndicated, offered, merchandised, advertised or described. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights in and to Your Content, and that the use of Your Content by SAP and its affiliates, Closers, and Referrers will not infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party. You are solely responsible for Your Content and for the maintenance of Your Content. You shall ensure that Your Content is free of all viruses, Trojan horses, and malicious code which could harm the systems or software used by SAP or its subcontractors to provide the ProMART Platform. Your Content shall be lawful, and may not be in any way offensive, distasteful, discriminatory, obscene, threatening, defamatory, seditious, pornographic, abusive, liable to incite racial hatred, menacing, scandalous, inflammatory, blasphemous, in breach of confidence, in breach of privacy or which may cause annoyance or inconvenience. Your Content may not constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, or give rise to civil or criminal liability.

2.7. RATINGS.
You acknowledge and agree that: (a) Vendors, Closers, Referrers, and Buyers will be prompted, through the ProMART Platform or otherwise, to provide a rating of you and, optionally, to provide comments or feedback about you and their interactions with you; and (b) you will be prompted, through the ProMART Platform or otherwise, to provide a rating of Vendors, Closers, Referrers, and Buyers and, optionally, to provide comments or feedback about your interactions with such Vendors, Closers, Referrers, and Buyers. You agree to provide your ratings and feedback in good faith. SAP reserves the right to use, share and display ratings, comments and feedback you provide, and ratings, comments, and feedback provided about you, in any manner in connection with the business of SAP or its affiliates with or without attribution to, or approval from, you. You acknowledge and agree that SAP and its affiliates are distributors (without any obligation to verify) and not publishers of ratings, comments and feedback you provide, or ratings, comments and feedback provided about you, provided that SAP and its affiliates reserve the right to edit or remove comments in the event that such comments: include obscenities or other objectionable content; include an individual’s name or other personal information; or violate any privacy laws, other applicable laws or regulations, or SAP’s or its affiliates’ content policies.

3. PRODUCT-SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY.
To be eligible to serve as a Closer or Referrer for certain products, you may be required to demonstrate that you have certain Vendor-mandated training, expertise and experience. The ProMART Platform may enable you to make representations to Vendors regarding your training, expertise and experience which may include you accessing content provided by Vendors or other third parties ("Vendor Content") through the ProMART Platform. Vendor Content is provided "as is." SAP makes no warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of Vendor Content. You use Vendor Content at your own risk, and SAP shall have no liability to you or any third party based on your use of or reliance on Vendor Content.

4. SALES FEES; REFERRAL FEES.
A sale ("Sale") is completed when a Buyer uses the ProMART Platform to purchase goods or services via the ProMART Platform. A sales fee ("Sales Fee") will be generally payable to a Closer for each Sale that is: (a) completed on the ProMART Platform, (b) indeed closed by such Closer in accordance with (i) this Participation Agreement and (ii) the Vendor specific terms and conditions (if any) for closing the Sale set forth by the Vendor on the product page, and (c) associated with a Closer’s profile. A referral fee ("Referral Fee") will generally be payable to a Referrer for each Sale that is completed on the ProMART Platform, that is indeed referred by such Referrer in accordance with the terms set forth by the Vendor on the product page, and that is associated with a Referrer’s profile. Payment of Sales Fees and Referral Fees, as applicable, will be made in accordance with Section 5. A Referral Fee may also be paid, in the Vendor’s sole discretion, in connection with sales not completed on the ProMART Platform in the event that a Vendor: (1) notifies SAP that a Referral Fee is due for such a sale; (2) provides SAP with certain information about the sale, including the amount of the Referral Fee due; and (3) completes a funds transfer to the third-party payments processor in the amount of the Referral Fee. The Sales Fee and Referral Fee payable, and the conditions and limitations thereof, for Sales of each product, if any, may vary and are displayed for each Vendor via the ProMART Platform. The applicable Sales Fee and/or Referral Fee payable, if any, will be the rate displayed via the ProMART Platform at the time the Buyer accepts the Sale. The Vendor, and not SAP, is responsible for the payment of any applicable Sales Fee and/or Referral Fee in accordance with all applicable terms.

5. PAYMENTS.
By registering for, accessing or using the ProMART Platform, you authorize SAP’s third-party payments processor to act as your agent for the purposes of processing payments, refunds and adjustments for Your Transactions (as defined below), receiving and holding Sales Fee and/or Referral Fees on your behalf, remitting Sales Fees and/or Referral Fees to your bank account, and paying SAP and its affiliates, Closers, Referrers, and Vendors any amounts you owe in accordance with this Participation Agreement or other agreements you may have with SAP or its affiliates (collectively, the "Transaction Processing Service"). "Sales Proceeds" means the gross proceeds from any of Your Transactions, including all shipping and handling and other charges, but excluding any taxes separately stated and charged. "Your Transaction" means any Sale in which you are entitled to a Sales Fee or Referral Fee in accordance with this Participation Agreement and, with respect to sales not completed on the ProMART Platform, any sale that a Vendor has confirmed, through the ProMART Platform, that a Referral Fee is payable to you. It is your responsibility to ensure that your bank account information associated with your account and profile is correct and up-to-date. You acknowledge and agree that any amounts payable to you shall not include any interest and will be net of any amounts required to be withheld by law. If SAP or the third-party payments processor believes that you have attempted to use the ProMART Platform to defraud or abuse SAP or any other party or otherwise violate the terms of this Participation Agreement, you agree that the third-party payments processor may withhold all or a portion of your Sales Fees and/or Referral Fees. You agree that Sales Fees and/or Referral Fees will generally only be paid when the third-party payments processor receives the Sales Proceeds. SAP is not responsible for the actions of the third-party payments processor. Your Sales Fees and/or Referral Fees may be subject to offset or refund if the Buyer returns the subject product. As a security measure, SAP or the third-party payments processor may, but shall not be required to, impose transaction limits on some or all Buyers and you relating to the value of any transaction, disbursement, or adjustment, the cumulative value of all transactions, disbursements, or adjustments during a period of time, or the number of transactions per day or other period of time. If SAP or the third-party payment processor reasonably concludes, based on information available to SAP or the third-party payment processor, that actions and/or performance in connection with the ProMART Platform may result in payment disputes, credit card chargebacks or other claims, then the third-party payments processor may delay initiating any remittances and withhold any payments to be made or that are otherwise due in connection with the ProMART Platform or this Participation Agreement until the completion of any investigation(s) regarding any actions and/or performance in connection with this Participation Agreement. SAP and the third-party payments processor will not be liable for acting or not acting in accordance with the provisions of this Section. You bear all risks of loss or fraud that occur in connection with Your Transactions. You authorize the third-party payments processor to obtain reimbursement of any amounts owed by you to SAP or any Vendor, Closer, Referrer, or Buyer by making deductions from payments due to you, charging your credit card, or debiting your bank account. You authorize the third-party payments processor to use any or all of the foregoing methods to seek reimbursement on behalf of itself and/or SAP.

6. RELATIONSHIP WITH SAP.
You and SAP are independent contractors. Nothing in this Participation Agreement is intended or should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, employment agency or employer-employee relationship between you and SAP. SAP does not in any way: supervise, direct, or control your services; set your hours, schedules, or the location where you provide services; or provide the premises at which you will perform your services. You have no authority to bind SAP or its affiliates and you undertake not to hold yourself out as an employee, agent or authorized representative of SAP or its affiliates. Where, by implication of law or otherwise, you may be deemed an agent or representative of any Vendor or SAP or its affiliates, you undertake and agree to indemnify, defend (at SAP’s option) and hold SAP and its affiliates harmless from and against any claims by any person or entity based on such implied agency or representative relationship (including, but not limited to, an employment relationship).

7. BENEFITS.
You are not entitled to, or eligible for, any benefits that SAP may make available to its employees, such as group insurance, profit sharing or retirement benefits. Because you will provide services as an independent contractor, SAP will not withhold taxes, make deductions or make payments for social security, make unemployment insurance or disability insurance contributions, or obtain workers’ compensation insurance on your behalf. You agree to report to all applicable government agencies as income all Sales Fees and/or Referral Fees received by you for services performed in connection with the ProMART Platform and/or this Participant Agreement.

SAP reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Participation Agreement at any time, effective upon posting the amended terms through the ProMART Platform. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Participation Agreement.

The SAP Marks may not be used in any manner that is likely to cause confusion.

You acknowledge that SAP is the owner and licensor of the SAP Marks, and that your use of the SAP Marks will confer no additional interest in or ownership of the SAP Marks in you but rather inures to the benefit of SAP. You agree to use the SAP Marks strictly in accordance with SAP’s Trademark Usage Guidelines, as may be provided to you and revised from time to time, and to immediately cease any use that SAP determines to be nonconforming or otherwise unacceptable.

THE PROMART PLATFORM AND THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. SAP MAKES NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

THE PROMART PLATFORM AND THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, ESCROW, TRAINING, MAINTENANCE, OR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS WHATSOEVER. SAP DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, WHETHER ARISING BY STATUTE OR IN LAW OR AS A RESULT OF A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you.

21. GENERAL RELEASE.
BECAUSE SAP IS NOT INVOLVED IN TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUYERS, VENDORS, REFERRERS AND/OR CLOSERS OR OTHER PARTICIPANT DEALINGS, IF A DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN ONE OR MORE PARTICIPANTS, EACH OF YOU RELEASE SAP (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, OFFICERS, REPRESENTATIVES AND EMPLOYEES) FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.

22. INDEMNITY/LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
22.1. INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE.
You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless SAP and each of its affiliates (and their respective employees, directors, agents and representatives) from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, penalties, interest and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any Claim that arises out of or relates to: (i) any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties, or obligations set forth in this Participation Agreement; (ii) your own website or other sales channels, the products you sell, any content you provide, the advertisement, offer, sale or return of any products you sell, any actual or alleged infringement of any intellectual property or proprietary rights by any products you sell or content you provide, or Seller Taxes or the collection, payment or failure to collect or pay Seller Taxes; (iii) your, your agents or representatives, or Your Company's negligence or wilful misconduct; (iv) any alleged employment or agency relationship between you and any Vendor or SAP, including any claim that any Vendor or SAP violated any employment laws, including, but not limited to, those relating to worker classification, overtime, and meal and rest breaks; or (v) any obligation by any Vendor or SAP to pay any withholding taxes, social security, unemployment or disability insurance or similar items in connection with any payment made to you. For purposes hereof: "Claim" means any claim, action, audit, investigation, inquiry or other proceeding instituted by a person or entity (including a government entity).

22.2. NO INDIRECT DAMAGES.
IN NO EVENT SHALL SAP OR its affiliates (and their respective employees, directors, agents and representatives) BE LIABLE TO YOU, YOUR COMPANY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS Participation AGREEMENT, THE PROMART PLATFORM, THE MATERIALS, THE TRANSACTION PROCESSING SERVICE, THE INABILITY TO USE THE PROMART PLATFORM OR THE TRANSACTION PROCESSING SERVICE, ANY ALLEGED employment or agency relationship between you and any Vendor or SAP or alleged WORKER misclassification of you by any Vendor or SAP, OR RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE PROMART PLATFORM.

22.3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
IN NO EVENT SHALL SAP OR its affiliates (and their respective employees, directors, agents and representatives) BE LIABLE TO YOU, YOUR COMPANY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF $500 ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS Participation AGREEMENT, THE PROMART PLATFORM, THE MATERIALS, THE TRANSACTION PROCESSING SERVICE, THE INABILITY TO USE THE PROMART PLATFORM OR THE TRANSACTION PROCESSING SERVICE, ANY ALLEGED employment or agency relationship between you and any Vendor or SAP or alleged WORKER misclassification of you by any Vendor or SAP, OR RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE PROMART PLATFORM.

23. APPLICABLE LAW.
The laws of the state of New York govern this Participation Agreement and all of its terms and conditions, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws or the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Each party consents that any dispute or claim relating in any way to this Participation Agreement or your use of the ProMART Platform will be resolved by binding arbitration as described in Section 24 , rather than in court, except as described in Section 24.3 .

24. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION.
24.1. DISPUTES.
SAP is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any Vendor, Buyer, Closer, Referrer, or other third party. Disputes between you and SAP are subject to this Section 24. Because SAP is not the agent of you and is not the agent of any Buyer, Vendor, Closer or Referrer, SAP will not act as any participant’s agent in connection with resolving any disputes between participants related to or arising out of any transaction. SAP urges users of the ProMART Platform to cooperate with each other to resolve such disputes.

24.2. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and SAP in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and SAP agree that every dispute arising in connection with this Participation Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Participation Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Participation Agreement.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND SAP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE PROMART PLATFORM.

24.3. EXCEPTIONS.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 24.2, nothing in this Participation Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either you or SAP to:

1. bring an individual action in small claims court in New York County, New York; or

2. seek injunctive relief in a court of law of competent jurisdiction State of New York to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

24.4. ARBITRATOR; LOCATION OF PROCEEDINGS.
Any arbitration under this Participation Agreement will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Participation Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted:

a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator;

b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or

c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in New York, New York.

24.5. NOTICE PROCESS.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if SAP does not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice") to you.

SAP’s address for Notice is:

General Counsel, SAP 
3999 West Chester Pike

Newtown Square, PA 19073

The Notice must:

1. describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and

2. set forth the specific relief sought, as permitted by this Participation Agreement ("Demand").

You and SAP agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and SAP do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or SAP may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or SAP must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.

24.6. FEES.
If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Participation Agreement, SAP will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any filing fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.

If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then the arbitrator shall require the substantially prevailing party in such claim to be reimbursed its attorneys' fees and costs from the other party or parties. Except as set forth in the prior sentence, the arbitrator shall not render an award for attorneys' fees or costs.

24.7. NO CLASS ACTIONS.
YOU AND SAP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

24.8. ENFORCEABILITY.
Regardless of whether any of this Section 24 is found to be unenforceable, the parties agree that the exclusive venue for any action arising out of or related to this Participation Agreement shall be in the State of New York.

25. TERMINATION; SURVIVAL.
SAP, in its sole discretion, may terminate this Participation Agreement, access to part or all of the ProMART Platform, or any current transactions immediately without notice for any reason. The following Sections survive any termination of this Participation Agreement: Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 17 through and including 26.

26. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
26.1. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
This Participation Agreement, including any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and cancels all prior and contemporaneous agreements, claims, representations, and understandings of the parties in connection with the subject matter hereof.

26.2. NO AGENCY; THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY.
You and SAP are independent contractors and nothing in this Participation Agreement will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between you and any Vendor or SAP. Nothing expressed or mentioned in or implied from this Participation Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give to any person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or in respect to this Participation Agreement. This Participation Agreement and all of the representations, warranties, covenants, conditions, and provisions hereof are intended to be and are for the sole and exclusive benefit of SAP, you, and relying Buyers, Vendors, Referrers or Closers.

26.3. SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this Participation Agreement shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

26.4. HEADINGS.
Titles and headings used in this Participation Agreement and any applicable policies, procedures and guidelines are for convenience only and shall not be used in the interpretation of any such documents.

26.5. INTERPRETATION.
The rule of contractual construction that ambiguities shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used in the interpretation of this Participation Agreement and any applicable policies, procedures and guidelines.

26.6. NO WAIVER.
SAP will not be considered to have waived any of its rights or remedies described in this Participation Agreement unless the waiver is in writing and signed by the relevant party. No delay or omission by SAP in exercising its rights or remedies will impair or be construed as a waiver. Any single or partial exercise of a right or remedy will not preclude further exercise of any other right or remedy. SAP's failure to enforce the strict performance of any provision of this Participation Agreement will not constitute a waiver of either party's right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provisions of this Participation Agreement. SAP does not guarantee that it will take action against any or all breaches of this Participation Agreement.
