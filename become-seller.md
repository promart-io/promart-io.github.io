Earn top commissions representing the innovative new technology brand ProMART.

You have access to the huge numbers of ready to use Solutions tailored for the industry you are working in.

There are several important points you have to negotiate with the Vendor who has the tailored application you have a Customer for:

* The amount of the commission which you will get as a bonus
* Whether this bonus will be one time only or will be counted each and every time your Customer renews its contract (e.g. pays the monthly fee via the Marketplace)
* Whether you will play the primary support role for your Customer(s) or it will be the Vendor (the regular case)
* Whether you will negotiate the exact obligations and features that has to become part of the contract with the Customer or Vendor will do this (or both)

Be aware that the contracts and/or negotiations between the Seller and Vendor are bilateral and ProMART does not play an intermediary role of any kind.
