ProMART is devoted to build a healthy partners ecosystem. We have defined a few roles based on the main activities our partners perform within the network.

Having in mind that ProMART focuses on SME and Micro-Enterprises, the roles above should not be strictly associated with a separated legal entity nor individual.
A single partner can be registered as any of the roles above and can play by itself the end to end process from the development to composing and selling the applications to the end customers.

The fair-share distribution of the income is crucial for ProMART to function. The EcoTax is the innovative approach for such a distribution.
It is a flat tax based on the amount of the closed deal form the Marketplace and it is distributed equally to all the modules the sold solution consist of.
